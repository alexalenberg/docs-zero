<Note>
  TLDR: If you’re reading this, it’s because we need to test your energy provider.

  [Complete this form,](https://flatpeak.typeform.com/openrewards) and we will send you a rewards payment via bank transfer or Amazon voucher.
</Note>

### About us

Flatpeak helps smart devices like electric vehicles and heat pumps to use electricity when it's cheapest and cleanest by connecting directly to real-time energy prices.

We achieve this by securely accessing **real-time tariff data** from energy providers (also known as utilities or suppliers), which enables devices to operate at optimal times.

## What We’re Asking For

To complete the test, we need **temporary, read-only access** to your energy account:

- **Login email + password** (used only to check tariff data)
- You may create a **temporary password** (e.g. _Password123!_) before sharing.
- Please **keep this password active for 2 months**, as we may need to repeat the test a few times.

💳 Your thank you payment will be sent by **bank transfer** or **Amazon voucher** (where available in your country).

### Why participate?

- 🌳 Support climate tech and innovation.
- 📉 Help lower energy bills for everyone.
- 💰 **Get paid €100/$100** for helping out.

### Data & Security

- 👁️‍🗨️ **Read-only access** to log in to see if our system can automatically read your tariff data
- 🔒 Credentials are **automatically deleted after 3 months**
- ♻️ You can **change your password** before and after the test for extra peace of mind

We have tested accounts with hundreds of providers worldwide, including **Octopus, Tibber, and PG&E** — all without issue. You can see our current integrations here.

## Q&A

**Can Flatpeak access any sensitive data on my account?**\
No. We can only see your address and energy account information (like tariff details, contract type, and billing overview). Some providers may display the last 4 digits of a saved card, but full details are not visible. We only look at tariff data — nothing else.

**Do you make any changes to my account?**\
Never. We don’t make changes, and we don’t store your personal information. We only check how your provider displays tariff data, and test that this data could be securely shared if you connect a device (like an EV or heat pump).

**Can I change my password afterwards?**\
Yes, absolutely. Many people create a temporary password before sharing. We ask you to keep it active for up to 2 months, as sometimes we need to re-run tests, but we’ll let you know once everything is complete.

**When will I receive the reward payment?**\
As soon as we confirm your login details work, we’ll send your reward the same day. Amazon vouchers usually arrive instantly, while bank transfers can take a couple of working days to show in your account.


### Energy provider priority list

- If your energy provider is on this list, you’ll receive a €100 reward after completing the form.
- We need **only one account per provider per country**.
- If your provider isn’t listed, you can still participate—just fill out the form and receive €50. You can further benefit by sharing the link and earning referral rewards.

Where you act as a data controller of Customer Personal Data, you guarantee that all processing activities are lawful, have a specific purpose, and any required notices and consents or other appropriate legal basis are in place to enable lawful transfer of the Customer Personal Data. If you are a data processor (in which case we will act as a Sub-processor), you will ensure that the relevant data controller guarantees that the conditions listed in section 4.1 are met.

4.2 **Compliance**. You are solely responsible for (a) ensuring that you comply with the Data Protection Laws applicable to your use of the Services and to your own processing of Customer Personal Data, (b) making an independent assessment of whether the technical and organisational measures of the Services meet your requirements, and (c) implementing and maintaining privacy and security measures for components that you provide or control (including but not limited to passwords, devices used with the Services and Customer Applications).


#### 5. Security

5.1 **Security Measures**. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect Customer Personal Data from Personal Data Breaches and to preserve the security, integrity, availability, resiliency and confidentiality of the Customer Data our systems use for processing Customer Personal Data. The security measures applied by us are described in Appendix II.

5.2 **Updates to Security Measures**. You are responsible for reviewing the information made available by us relating to Customer Personal Data security and making an independent assessment as to whether such information meets your requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws. You acknowledge that the security measures are subject to technical progress and development and that we may update or modify our security measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Customer Personal Data.

5.3 **Access Controls**. We apply the principles of “need to know “and “least privilege” ensuring that access to Customer Personal Data is limited to those Personnel required for the provisioning of the Services and in line with the Agreement, including this DPA.

5.4 **Confidentiality of Processing**. We will ensure that any person or party who is authorised by us to process Customer Personal Data (including our personnel, agents and Sub-processors) are informed of the confidential nature of such Customer Personal Data and will be under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty) that survives termination of their engagement.

5.5 **Personal Data Breach Response and Notification**.

We will handle disclosure requests in accordance with the [Disclosure Request Policy](https://docs.flatpeak.com/disclosure-requests).


#### 8. Subprocessors

8.1 **Use of Subprocessors**. By means of this DPA, you provide a general written authorisation to us to engage Subprocessors for the processing of Customer Personal Data subject to the following requirements:

8.1.1 We will restrict access to Customer Personal Data by Subprocessors to what is strictly necessary to provide the services specified in the subprocessor agreement;

8.1.2 We will agree upon data protection obligations with the Subprocessor that are substantially the same as the obligations under this DPA; and

8.2. The list of Subprocessors forms an integral part of this Agreement and is available at https://docs.flatpeak.com/legal/subprocessors or a successor URL.


#### 9. Cross Border Transfers of Customer Personal Data

9.1 **Transfers of Customer Personal Data**. We may transfer Customer Personal Data on the condition that all appropriate safeguards required by Data Protection Legislation are in place. This may include a prior data transfer impact assessment, the adoption, monitoring and evaluation of supplementary technical, organisational and legal measures, enforceable data subject rights, and that effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.

9.2 **Subprocessor Standard Contractual Clauses**. Unless an adequacy decision or alternative transfer mechanism applies, we have entered into and shall maintain Standard Contractual Clauses with Subprocessors (including our Affiliates) located outside the EEA, subject to the terms set out in Section 9.1 of this DPA.

9.3 **Transfer Mechanisms for Customer Personal Data Transfers**. To the extent your use of the Services requires a cross-border data transfer mechanism to lawfully export Customer Personal Data from a jurisdiction (e.g. the EEA, California, Singapore, Switzerland, the or the United Kingdom) to us located outside of that jurisdiction this section will apply. If, in the performance of the Services, Customer Personal Data that is subject to the GDPR or any other law relating to the protection or privacy of individuals that applies to this DPA is transferred to Flatpeak located in countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the Data Protection Legislation, the transfer mechanisms listed below shall apply to such transfers and can be directly enforced by the parties to the extent such transfers are subject to the Data Protection Legislation:

9.3.1 The parties agree that the **Standard Contractual Clauses** will apply to Customer Personal Data that is transferred via the Services from the EEA or Switzerland, either directly or via onward transfer, to a Flatpeak entity located in a country outside the EEA or Switzerland that is not recognised by the European Commission (or, in the case of transfers from Switzerland, the competent authority for Switzerland) as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.

9.3.1.1 When you are acting as a data controller, and Flatpeak is a data processor, the EU Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses will apply to any such transfer of Customer Personal Data from the EEA. When you are acting as a data processor and Flatpeak is a subprocessor, the Processor-to-Subprocessor Standard Contractual Clauses will apply to any such transfer of Customer Personal Data from the EEA.

9.3.1.2 Flatpeak will be deemed the data importer, and you will be deemed the data exporter under the Standard Contractual Clauses. Each party’s signing of this DPA will be treated as a signing of the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses, which will be deemed incorporated into this DPA. Details required under Annex 1 and Annex 2 to the Standard Contractual Clauses are available in Appendix I and Appendix II to this DPA. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail solely with respect to a transfer of Customer Personal Data from the EEA.

9.3.1.3 Where the Standard Contractual Clauses require the parties to choose between optional clauses and to input information, the parties have done so as set out below:



* The Optional Clause 7 “Docking clause” shall not be adopted.
* For Clause 9, “Use of sub-processors”, the parties elect the following option: “Option 2 General written authorisation: the data importer has the controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the controller in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of subprocessors at least 10 business days in advance, thereby giving the controller sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object. The data importer shall inform the data exporter of the engagement of the sub-processor(s).”
* For Clause 11 (a) “Redress”, the parties do not adopt the Option.
* For Clause 17, “Governing law”, the parties elect the following option: “Option 1. These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of the Netherlands.”
* For Clause 18 (b) “Choice of Forum and Jurisdiction”: “The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of England and Wales.”

9.3.2 The parties agree that the UK Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses will apply to Customer Personal Data that is transferred via the Services from the United Kingdom, either directly or via onward transfer, to a Flatpeak entity located in a country outside the United Kingdom that is not recognised by the competent United Kingdom regulatory authority or governmental body for the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data.

9.3.2.1 Flatpeak will be deemed the data importer, and you will be deemed the data exporter under the UK Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses. Each party’s signing of this DPA will be treated as signing of the UK Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses, which will be deemed incorporated into this DPA. Details required under Annex 1 and Annex 2 to the UK Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses are available in Appendix I and Appendix II to this DPA. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the UK Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail solely with respect to the transfer of Customer Personal Data from the United Kingdom.


#### 10. Audit

10.1 **Audit Report**. Our communication platform shall be regularly audited against the ISO 27001:2013 standard (or equivalent). The audit may, at our sole discretion, be an internal audit or an audit performed by a third party. Upon written request, we will provide you with a summary of the audit report(s) (“Audit Report”), so that you can verify our compliance with the audit standards and this DPA. Such Audit Reports, as well as any conclusions or findings specified therein, are our Confidential Information.

10.2 **Customer information requests**. We will make available to you all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA. We will provide written responses to reasonable requests for information made by you, including responses to information security and audit questionnaires that are reasonable in scope and necessary to confirm compliance with this DPA, provided that you (i) have first made a reasonable effort to obtain the requested information from the Documentation, Audit Reports and other information provided or made public by us, and (ii) will not exercise this right more than once per year, unless a Personal Data Breach or significant change in our processing activities in relation to the Services require that an additional questionnaire is executed. All responses provided are our Confidential Information.

10.3 **Customer Audit**. If an Audit Report provided by us to you gives you substantiated reasons to believe that we are in breach of our obligations under this DPA related to the Customer Personal Data provided by you, we will allow an independent and qualified third-party auditor appointed by you and approved by us, to audit the relevant applicable Personal Data processing activities, provided that the following requirements are met:



* You shall give us at least sixty (60) days reasonable advance notice before exercising the right to audit;
* The auditor agrees to market standard confidentiality obligations with us;
* You and the auditor take measures to minimise disruption to our business operations;
* The audit will be carried out during regular business hours;
* We shall not be obliged to provide access to customer data of other customers or systems not involved in the provision of the Services; and
* You shall pay for all the audit costs.


#### 11. Deletion and Return of Customer Personal Data

Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, we will (at your election) delete or return to you all Customer Personal Data (including copies) in our possession or control, save that this requirement will not apply to the extent we are required by law to retain some or all of the Customer Personal Data. If you instruct us to delete Customer Personal Data, Customer Personal Data archived on our backup systems will be protected from further processing and deleted when the required retention period has passed.


#### 12. Customer Affiliate Communication and Rights

The entering into this DPA in the name and on behalf of a Customer Affiliate as set out in Section 1.2 constitutes a separate DPA between us and that Customer Affiliate, subject to the following:

12.1. **Communication**. The Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall remain responsible for coordinating all communication with us under this DPA and be entitled to make and receive any communication in relation to this DPA on behalf of its Customer Affiliates.

12.2 **Rights of Customer Affiliates**. Where a Customer Affiliate becomes a party to the DPA with us, it shall, to the extent required under Data Protection Legislation, be entitled to exercise the rights and seek remedies under this DPA, subject to the following:

(i) Unless Data Protection Legislation requires the Customer Affiliate to exercise a right or seek a remedy under this DPA against Flatpeak directly by itself, the parties agree that (i) solely the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such right or seek any such remedy on behalf of the Customer Affiliate, and (ii) the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such rights under this DPA not separately for each Customer Affiliate individually but in a combined manner for itself and all of its Customer Affiliates together.

(ii) The parties agree that the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall, when an on-site audit of the procedures relevant to the protection of Customer Personal Data is being carried out on its behalf as set forth in Section 10.3 of this DPA, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on us by combining, to the extent reasonably possible, several audit requests carried out on behalf of itself and all of its Customer Affiliates in one single audit.

For clarity, a Customer Affiliate does not become a contracting party to the Agreement.


#### 13. California Consumer Privacy Act

We make the following additional commitments to you with respect to the processing of Customer Personal Data within the scope of the CCPA.

13.1 **Our Obligations**. We shall comply with the CCPA and treat all Customer Personal Data subject to the CCPA (“CCPA Personal Data”) in accordance with the provisions of the CCPA. With respect to CCPA Personal Data, we are a service provider under the CCPA. We will not (a) sell CCPA Personal Data; (b) retain, use or disclose any CCPA Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of providing the Services, including retaining, using or disclosing CCPA Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than providing the Services; or (c) retain, use or disclose CCPA Personal Data outside of our direct business relationship with you. The Processing of CCPA Personal Data is authorised by your instructions in the Terms and this DPA is integral to our provision of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that our access to Customer Data does not constitute part of the consideration exchanged under the Agreement. To the extent that any usage data is considered CCPA Personal Data, we are the business with respect to such data and will process that data in accordance with our Privacy Statement. The terms “business”, “commercial purpose”, “service provider”, and “sell”, as used in Section 13.1 have the meanings given to them in the CCPA. Both parties certify that they understand and will comply with the obligations and restrictions set forth in this DPA and the Agreement as required under the CCPA.

13.2 **Customer Obligations**. You represent and warrant that you have provided notice to the End-User that the Personal Data is being used or shared in accordance with the terms and conditions envisaged in Section 1798.140(t)(2)(C)(i) of the CCPA. You are responsible for compliance with the requirements of the CCPA applicable to you as a data controller.

#### APPENDIX II TO THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES

Where applicable, this Appendix II will serve as Annex II to the Standard Contractual Clauses. The following provides more information regarding our technical and organisational security measures set forth below.

**Technical and Organizational Security Measures**:

Measures of pseudonymisation and protection of Personal Data in storage and transit: All Personal Data is encrypted in transit and at rest and, to the extent relevant from a security standpoint, treated as if it were classified as sensitive data. Information is always transmitted over TLS with up-to-date encryption methodologies by default.

Measures for ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability and resilience of processing systems and services: we enter into agreements that contain confidentiality provisions with our employees, contractors, vendors, and Subprocessors. Our business continuity policy is to prepare our business and services in the event of extended outages caused by factors beyond our control and to restore services to the widest extent possible in a minimum time frame. We understand the services we provide are mission-critical to our customers and, therefore, have very little tolerance for service disruptions. Our timeframes for recovery are designed to ensure we can meet our obligations to all of our customers.

Processes for regular testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures in order to ensure the security of processing: The goal of information security and our Information Security Management System (ISMS) is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information to the organisation, employees, partners, customers and the (authorised) information systems, and to minimise the risk of damage occurring by preventing security incidents and managing security threats and vulnerabilities. Our Legal Team, Data Protection Officer, and Security and Compliance Team make sure that applicable regulations and standards are factored into our security frameworks.

Measures for user identification and authorisation: We follow principles of “need to know“ and “least privilege”. We promote the use of role-based access control. Provisioning and de-provisioning are overseen by the security team, with Single-Sign-On and 2FA by default. Owners have been defined for each information asset who is responsible for ensuring access to their systems is appropriate and reviewed on a regular basis. Whenever dealing with sensitive information or taking critical action, we use the four-eyes principle.

Measures for ensuring events logging: Audit logs are centrally stored and monitored on a regular basis for security events and are kept secure to avoid the risk of tampering. The Incident Management Policy enforces the incident response plan and its procedures. These guidelines are being followed if any type of security or technical incident occurs. In the event that there are Security incidents, they will be reviewed regularly by the Security Steering Committee, which consists of senior stakeholders from across the business.

Measures for ensuring systems configuration, including default configuration: We follow a consistent change management process for all the changes to the production environment of the Communication Platform as a Service. To elaborate further, all requests for changes (RFC) need to be approved by a designated party and executed according to the formal change control process. The control process ensures that changes proposed are reviewed, authorised, tested, implemented, and released in a controlled manner; and that the status of each proposed change is monitored. Configuration baselines are followed to securely configure the systems by following best practices. Also, within the Engineering department, a tech radar is used to define which technologies (languages, platform tools, databases and data management tools) can be adopted or need to be avoided during development.

Measure for physical security: We actively promote a “Work from Anywhere” policy so our employees are free to work from any place they want. However, we still have our office premises. We have no secure areas/data centre on our premises as we are a completely cloud-based company. Our office floors are protected by physical access controls, CCTV, and manned security.

Measures for internal IT and IT security governance and management: We maintain a risk-based assessment security program, which includes administrative, organisational, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the Services and confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data. Our information security program is set up in a systematic and well-organized way. In addition, legal and regulatory requirements apply to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information to the organisation, employees, partners and customers. All these are translated into our information security policies, procedures and guidelines. We have a Security Steering Committee which is responsible for the tactical level of information security. This entails the coordination of information security activities and the translation of strategic activities to operational activities for our security, and our continuous maintenance of regulatory compliance. All employees are responsible for safeguarding company assets. All our employees are screened for expertise, experience, and integrity. Employees are informed about security and data protection at the onboarding stage, as well as by way of regular team-specific training and other company-wide all-hands presentations about the importance of data protection and security compliance.

All our hosting providers are ISO/IEC 27001:2013 compliant.

Measures for certifications/assurance of processes and products: We undergo rigorous surveillance as well as certification audits and regularly execute application vulnerability and penetration testing. Flatpeak takes a unified approach to patch and vulnerability management to ensure that our standard SLA timelines are maintained whether vulnerabilities exist in our underlying infrastructure, operating platforms, or source code.

Measures for application security: We ensure the security of our applications during the design and development phase based on the Flatpeak Secure Code Guidelines:



* Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release;
* Code changes are reviewed by skilled individuals (who are familiar with code review and secure development) other than the originating developers;
* Code reviews are performed to ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines such as OWASP;
* Applications will undergo rigorous application security testing to identify any new threats and vulnerabilities at least annually (in accordance with industry standards and best practices);
* All code changes for applications that are pushed to production environments are reviewed using manual and/or automated processes.
* Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release.
* Code changes are reviewed by skilled individuals (who are familiar with code review and secure development) other than the originating developers.
* Applications will undergo rigorous application security testing to identify any new threats and vulnerabilities at least annually (in accordance with industry standards and best practices).
* All code changes for applications that are pushed to production environments are reviewed using manual and/or automated processes.

Penetration tests are conducted annually and case-by-case on new products/features. Automated source code analysis tools are being used to detect security defects in code prior to deployment based on the language.

Measures for vulnerability disclosure: We appreciate security researchers who have found vulnerabilities on our platform contacting us and sending their findings to [security@flatpeak.com.](mailto:security@flatpeak.com.) We have a dedicated security team who follow up and send invitations to our bug bounty program to investigate and remediate where necessary.

Measures for ensuring accountability: We implement information security and data protection policies in accordance with applicable laws. We have appointed a dedicated Compliance and Information Security and a Data Protection Officer and maintain documentation of our processing activities, including recording and reporting security incidents involving Personal Data where applicable.

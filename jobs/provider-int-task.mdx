### Overview
Develop a web scraping script to log into an energy provider’s end-user dashboard using provided credentials and extract the following tariff details:

- **Tariff Name**
- **Contract Start Date** (if available)
- **Contract End Date** (if available)
- **Tariff Rates** applicable to the user's agreement

### Technical requirements
- The script should be implemented in **Node.js**.
- Use **fetch, axios, or any other suitable HTTP library**.
- If direct requests are blocked (e.g., CAPTCHA, JS auth), use a **headless browser (Puppeteer/Playwright) as fallback**.
- The extracted data should be structured as a JSON object.
- Error handling should be implemented for login failures, session timeouts, and data extraction errors.
- The code should be modular and reusable.

### Deliverables
- Well-documented Node.js script
- Run instructions (including dependencies)
- Any required config files (e.g., .env for credentials)
- Example output JSON

### Additional notes
- **Use a VPN with a server in the provider’s country during development.**
- Use provider API access for tariffs if available (preferred over scraping).
- Design for **scalability and maintainability**.

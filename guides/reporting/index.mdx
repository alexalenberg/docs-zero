Flatpeak energy cost reporing APIs enable you to calculate energy cost in real-time, or report it aggregated by session, day, week, month or a year. All reporting endpoints support both **device** and **locaiton** (i.e. property address) levels and can take into account [local (i.e. solar)](/guides/reporting/local-generation) generaion.

You can also sync our raw tariff rates and make all calculations in your systems.

title: Events
---

You will notice that events follow a pattern: `resource.event`. Our goal is to provide a consistent system that makes things easier to anticipate and code against.

## Filtering Events

Events can be filtered to only show a single type using the `event_type` query parameter.

```bash Example request
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.flatpeak.com/events?event_type=location.create' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

## Event Types

This is a list of all the types of events currently available from the [events](/api-reference/zero/events/list-all-events) API endpoint.

We may add more at any time, so you should not assume that only these types exist when developing and maintaining your code.

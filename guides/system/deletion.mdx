The Flatpeak supports deletion for several object types.

When an object is deleted, related objects may also be removed—or their references unlinked.
This page outlines how deletion behaves across different object types and relationships.
## Customer

When a [customer is deleted](/api-reference/zero/customers/delete-a-customer):

- All Locations belonging to this Customer are also deleted.

## Location

When a [location is deleted](/api-reference/zero/locations/delete-a-location):

- The Customer it belongs to is updated to remove the deleted Location.
- All Tariffs associated with this Location are deleted.

## Tariff

When a [tariff (element) is deleted](/api-reference/zero/tariffs/delete-a-tariff-element):

- The Location object it was associated with is updated.
- All related Connect information is deleted, including energy provider connection data (keys, credentials, etc).

## Device

When a [device is deleted](/api-reference/zero/devices/delete-a-device):

- No other objects are updated.

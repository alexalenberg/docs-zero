Each major platform release may include changes that are not backward-compatible. Upgrading to a new major release can require updates to your code.

Backward-compatible changes introduced outside a major release are announced in the [Changelog](changelog), but the version number will not be incremented.

By default, requests use your Flatpeak account’s default API version (set in the Dashboard). You can override it by adding the `Flatpeak-Version` header:

```json
❯ curl -s --request GET \
  --url "https://api.flatpeak.com/devices/dev_66b1ea3cbbfa0d30b978ce37" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header 'Flatpeak-Version: 2025-09-14.anode'
```

Webhook events are emitted according to the API version used when the related object was created. For example:

- Creating a location with `2024-08-24.zero`, will emit events in the Zero version.
- Creating a location with `2025-09-14.anode`, will emit events in the Anode version.

You can upgrade your default API version in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.flatpeak.com/settings/versions) > **Settings** > **Versions**. As best practice, test new version by adding the header before upgrading. It is **not possible** to downgrade once you upgraded to the higher verion in Dashboard.

### Errors

If you are trying to pass `Flatpeak-Version` header for a version that lower than one you configured in the Dashboard (your default version) you will receive the following error

```json HTTP 422 Error

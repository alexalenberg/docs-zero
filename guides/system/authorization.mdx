<Tip>**TLDR**: API requests are authorised using bearer tokens. Generating a token requires a Flatpeak account_id and an API key. Get both in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.flatpeak.com/keys) and obtain a token at [login](/api-reference/zero/login/create-a-bearer-token) endpoint.</Tip>

<Accordion icon="alien-8bit" title="What is Bearer Authentication?">

Flatpeak uses Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) to authorise access to API endpoints. This is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “giving access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

## Authenticating to Flatpeak API

Follow two simple steps below to start making requests to Flatpeak API endpoints:

<Steps>
<Step title="Get an API key">

You can create, view and delete API keys in [<nobr>API keys</nobr>](https://dashboard.flatpeak.com/keys) section of the Flatpeak Dashboard. You can create multiple keys so you can use separate keys at various parts of your service and perform key rotation without interrupting the operation of your service.

<Warning>Never place your API keys at a location where they can be accessed by unauthorised personnel, your website visitors or the general public.</Warning>

</Step>
<Step title="Create a bearer token">

To make requests to Flatpeak API endpoints, you first need to generate a `bearer_token` at the [login](/api-reference/zero/login/create-a-bearer-token) endpoint. This endpoint uses HTTP Basic Authentication. The username is your Flatpeak `account_id` and the password is the `api_key`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example request
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.flatpeak.com/login \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic base64(account_id:api_key)'
```
```json Example response
{
  "bearer_token": "<token>",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

You can use the `bearer_token` to make calls to any Flatpeak [API endpoints](/api-reference) until it expires. The expiry time is returned together with the token in the `expires_in` field. Get a new token before the one you are using expires to avoid failed requests.

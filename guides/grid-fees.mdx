Grid fees, **also known as non-commodity tariffs**, include all non-energy charges, such as network transmission fees, related taxes, and regulatory levies. These are always location-specific and are referred to as `NON_COMMODITY` tarffs in Flatpeak.

## Glossary

Flatpeak splits energy price into two components:

- `COMMODITY` Cost of the energy itself.
- `NON_COMMODITY` Cost to deliver energy (network fees, etc.).


## Why are grid fees handled separately?

Most providers do not show grid fees in customer dashboards—they typically appear only on bills. Automatically including them can confuse your customers when reported rates do not match what they see in their provider dashboard.

## How customers can add grid fees

In your app, provide a button or control that allows customers to add grid fees. This should trigger the Connect session in the same way you handle commodity tariffs. The only difference: when creating the token, set the [tariff type](/api-reference/zero/connect/create-a-connect-token#body-type) to `NON_COMMODITY`.

If the customer has already connected a commodity tariff, you **must** also include the existing `location_id`, or Flatpeak won’t be able to associate the grid fees with the correct location.

After launching the Connect flow, Flatpeak will typically auto-detect grid fees using the provided address and show the [Tariff Summary](/api-reference/zero/connect/tariff-summary) page. If not, the customer may need to manually select their grid operator and/or tariff.

Once connected, grid fees are automatically included in all cost reporting endpoints.

### Auditing

To review the grid fees, call the [tariff-rates-audit](/api-reference/zero/tariffs/audit-tariff-rates) endpoint and inspect the `non_commodity` section.

Flatpeak allows you to offer your own branded energy plans by partnering with a supported white-label energy provider. Currently, only [Nomos](https://nomos.energy) — available in Germany and Austria — is supported, but we plan to add more providers in Q3 2025 and beyond.

### How it works

Once set up, your brand will appear on the [provider selection](/api-reference/zero/connect/provider-selection) page in Connect, allowing your customers to select it during onboarding. After login, their tariff details will be accessible via the Flatpeak APIs.

When implementing Flatpeak you will need to provide your support team with tools to quickly assess the status of customer's tariff connection and assist with making changes.

This guide shows how to use Flatpeak’s tools to add visibility and control of tariff connections directly into your Support Dashboard.


## Reuse the Tariff settings page from your app

The fastest way to see what your customer sees and if required modify it, integrate Flatpeak into your support tools by building a version of the Tariff settings page inside your Support Dashboard:

<Frame>
<img
  src="/images/tariff-settings-page--admin.png"
/>
</Frame>

[Tariff settings page](/guides/connect/settings-page) guide.

## Implementation plan

<Note>Flatpeak stores tariffs at the Location level (with each Location linked to a Customer), not on the Customer object itself. This means your support tools should handle a one-to-many relationship between customers and locations—unless you only support a single location per customer in your core service.</Note>

The following plan assumes you support multiple locations per customer:

| Step | Action                                                                 |
|:-----|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | For each customer account, check if any Location has a Flatpeak Location ID. |
| 2    | For each Location with a Flatpeak Location ID, implement a status snippet similar to the illustration above. Refer to Tariff settings > [View or update](/guides/connect/settings-page#view-or-update) for details. |
| 3    | Allow your support team to use the view the tariff status and launch Connect on behalf of the customer and manage their tariff. |

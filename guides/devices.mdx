Various Flatpeak API endpoints require you to use device identifiers. These represent a physical or virtual device in your systems.

To create a device identifier, use the [create-device](/api-reference/zero/devices/create-a-device) endpoint. For cross-reference, we recommend that you populate the `reference_id` field with the unique ID of that device as used in your systems.

```json Example request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.flatpeak.com/devices \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "reference_id": "DEV1234567890"
}'
```
```json Example response
{
  "id": "dev_63a6087272941ef077a8fd3e",
  "object": "device",
  "live_mode": true,
  "reference_id": "DEV1234567890"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Store Flatpeak `device_id` from the response in your systems as a cross-reference to your internal device identifier, in this example, `DEV1234567890`.

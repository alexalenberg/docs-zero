If all the input information you have is the amount of time your device needs to be consuming or exporting energy, call the [scheduling-duration](/api-reference/zero/slots/get-slots-time) API endpoint.

Flatpeak will use the Location tariff and, if present, data on [local generation](/guides/reporting/local-generation) to find the lowest (or highest) cost time slots within the specified time period. For example, you can find the lowest-priced 2 hours within a given time period.

title: Plan your integration
---

This guide will walk you through the process of planning your integration with Flatpeak.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable customers to connect their energy tariff in your app.">
  Flatpeak API includes a group of methods (collectively referred to as "**Connect**") for requesting your customer's consent to securely access their energy provider account to fetch the tariff -- or if Flatpeak has not yet integrated that provider, your customer will be able to enter their tariff manually.

You can choose from two different integration paths:

<Card title="WebView - Clone our reference implementation and embed it" icon="rocket" horizontal href="/guides/connect/webview">
  Get up and running fast with our open-source reference implementation of Flatpeak API for you app. Clone and deploy in hours. Click to jump to the section.

<Card title="Native - Build necessary pages in your app using Flatpeak API" icon="turtle" horizontal href="/guides/connect/api">
  Prefer a native UX? Use the API directly—our most popular but more dev-intensive method. Typically takes two weeks to go live. Click to jump to the section.

</Step>
<Step title="Use Flatpeak API to get their energy price, schedule, and calculate costs.">
  Once a customer completes the **Connect** flow, your backend can immediately query the Flatpeak API for their tariff data and access all other energy intelligence endpoints.

You can choose from two different integration paths for this step too:

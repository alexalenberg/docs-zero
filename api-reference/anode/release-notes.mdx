## Core data services

- 48-hour tariff forecasts across European regions
- Export market rate support for Europe
- Webhook notifications for raw tariff rate updates — replacing the [next_update](/api-reference/zero/tariffs/get-tariff-rates#response-next-update) flag for real-time event delivery.

## Scheduling

All endpoints are transitioned to POST and uniformed

- The slots-threshold (GET) endpoint has been replaced by a [time duration](/api-reference/anode/schedules/schedule-by-duration) POST endpoint.
It includes a new URI, updated object ID prefix, a new object name, and the maxiumum period between start_time and end_time is now 3 days.

- The Slots-time (GET) endpoint has been replaced by a [price limit](/api-reference/anode/schedules/schedule-by-limit) POST endpoint.
It includes a new URI, updated object ID prefix, a new object name, and the maximum period between start_time and end_time is now 3 days.

- The Schedules endpoint is now [amount of energy](api-reference/anode/schedules/schedule-by-amount) POST endpoint.
It includes a new URI, updated object ID prefix, and a new object name.

## Connect

**Token Create**

- Added `disconnect_tariff` action to disconnect a tariff without launching Connect.
- Added `route_options` to enable omitting [tariff name capture](api-reference/anode/connect/tariff-name-capture) and [contract term capture](/api-reference/anode/connect/contract-term-capture).
- New optional [advanced tariff capture](/api-reference/anode/connect/advanced-tariff-capture) page is added for complex commercial tariffs.
- The `connect_web_uri` is renamed to `connect_url` for clarity of function.


**Updates to page route naming**

- The route for [pending tariff connection](/api-reference/anode/connect/tariff-connection-pending) page is now called `tariff_connection_pending`.
- The route for [[failed tariff connection](/api-reference/anode/connect/tariff-connection-failed)] page is now called `tariff_connection_failed`.

**Tariff summary**

- New **Report a problem** action for end-users to flag incorrect tariffs is introduced.
- Rates are now displayed in **small** currency units (API continues to return **large** currency units).

**Other improvements**

- In [start session](/api-reference/anode/connect/start-a-connect-session): `session_start` now replaces `session_restore`.
- `BACK` action added to all pages to provide more reliable navigation.
- **Market surcharge** has been replaced with [surcharge capture](/api-reference/anode/connect/surcharge-capture) and [region selection](/api-reference/anode/connect/region-selection) pages.
- Navigation actions in [tariff summary](/api-reference/anode/connect/tariff-summary), [pending tariff connection](/api-reference/anode/connect/tariff-connection-pending) and [failed tariff connection](/api-reference/anode/connect/tariff-connection-failed) are simplified for easier navigation.
- **Session complete** page has been retired.
- `postal_address_type` variable added to [connect token create](/api-reference/anode/connect/create-a-connect-token). Filters providers and tariffs by RESIDENTIAL or COMMERCIAL. Auto-detected if unspecified.

## Errors

- All endpoints, including Connect, now return `400 Bad Request` instead of `409 Conflict` for validation errors.

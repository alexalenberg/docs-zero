<Steps>
<Step title="Subscribe to session complete event">
Go to the Dashboard [Webhooks](https://dashboard.flatpeak.com/webhooks) page and subscribe to the `connect.session.complete` event. This enables your backend to receive notifications when a tariff is connected, so you can start fetching tariff rates and using other energy scheduling and cost reporting endpoints.

This step only needs to be completed once.

</Step>

<Step title="Call Connect URL">
Make a request to the Connect URL as shown in this example:

<CodeGroup>
```json Your request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://connect.flatpeak.com \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "connect_token": "<connect_token>",
  "route": "session_start"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

 The response will be one of the predefined pages listed below. Your application must support handling all of these pages.
 </Step>
 </Steps>

<Tip>The `BACK` action is available on every page, it lets customers reliably return to the previous step.</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```json Your request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://connect.flatpeak.com \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "connect_token": "<connect_token>",
  "action": "BACK"
}'
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Your request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://connect.flatpeak.com \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "connect_token": "<connect_token>",
  "route": "session_restore"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

 The response will be one of the predefined pages (1 to 13) listed below and [complete-a-session](/api-reference/zero/connect/complete-a-connect-session) webhook. Your application must support handling all of these pages.

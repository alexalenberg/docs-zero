Connect will return this page if it cannot instantly access the customer’s tariff, such as during a provider's system outage.

**Page actions explained**:

| Action          | Result                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| `SAVE`          | Saves tariff configuration and closes the page. Connect will continue to try to connect the tariff in the background. |
| `DISCONNECT`    | Disconnects the pending tariff and enables the customer to go through the Connect flow again. |
| `DISMISS_DIRECT`| Disconnects the pending tariff and automatically skips the DIRECT option when the customer selects their provider. |

When you POST the response, Connect may return any of these [validation errors](/guides/system/errors):

| Error Code         | Error Description                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `action_missing`   | Action parameter is required.         |
| `action_invalid`   | Action parameter XX is not supported. |
| `data_json_invalid`    | Data does not conform to the JSON schema.   |

<Note>When a customer clicks **Save**, Connect will immediately complete the session, and you can obtain the Location ID. However, Tariff Rates and other API endpoints will return `error 422` ("code": "pending_connect") until Flatpeak's backend systems can access the tariff; this can happen in a minute, an hour, or a day. If the tariff cannot be accessed for over 48 hours, Flatpeak systems will [send a webhook](/guides/connect/lifecycle) `tariff.fetch.failed`</Note>

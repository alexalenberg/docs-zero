description: Customer enters their market rate surcharge.

If customers enter their tariff rate manually, depending on their choices, Connect may, depending on your customer's energy provider, request you to render a page where they can specify tariff rate surcharges. For example, they might be on a `MARKET` tariff and will be paying additional brokerage fees or taxes on top.

<Note>Surcharges are applied by first adding the fixed fee, then applying the percentage to the result.</Note>

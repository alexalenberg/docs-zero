The Flatpeak API is RESTful and resource-driven, using:
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- JSON for writes and reads
- [Bearer token authentication](/guides/system/authorization)
- [Sandbox mode](/guides/system/test-mode) (test API keys start with `sk_test_`; live keys with `sk_live_`)
- Consistent status codes across operations

## Connect endpoints

The Connect API operates differently:

|Feature | Details |
| :-| :- |
| **Endpoint** | Single endpoint, used like a JSON‑structured conversation |
| **Session ID** | A one-time-use `connect_token` authorises each session |
| **Flow Control** | Your app must handle every step of Connect session |
| **Usage** | Follow the [Connect guide](/guides/connect/api) to implement this flow |

## Developer tips

1. Use REST best practices for non-Connect endpoints
2. Ensure Authorization keys match environment (`sk_test_` vs `sk_live_`)
3. For Connect, follow session flow and handle all required pages
4. Test in sandbox mode before going live

**Flatpeak is an energy data platform** that integrates with energy providers (also known as suppliers or utilities) worldwide, allowing your end customers to authorise real-time access to their tariff data directly from their provider’s dashboard. This enables you to align the operation of connected devices with live energy costs—making them cheaper and greener to run.

## How it works

Flatpeak is an API-first service that you integrate into both your customer-facing app and backend systems:

<Steps>
<Step title="Your Customer-facing app">

Integrate the Flatpeak API to let users select their energy provider from a Flatpeak-supplied list and authorise access to their account. This allows Flatpeak to retrieve their tariff data on your behalf.

</Step>
<Step title="Your Backend systems">

Use the Flatpeak API to query real-time energy prices at your customer's address during your device’s operation cycle, or ask Flatpeak generate optimised run schedules—e.g. shifting usage to when electricity is cheapest or scheduling export when buy-back rates are highest.
